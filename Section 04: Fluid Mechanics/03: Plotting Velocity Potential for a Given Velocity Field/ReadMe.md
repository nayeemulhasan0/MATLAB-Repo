This document explains the MATLAB script provided in sections to clarify its purpose and functionality.

---
## **1. Initialization and Grid Creation**
```matlab
clear; clc

[X Y] = meshgrid(linspace(-5,5,100));
```
- **Purpose:** Clears the workspace (`clear`) and command window (`clc`) to ensure a clean environment.
- **Grid Creation:** A mesh grid is created using `linspace` to define a uniform grid of points from -5 to 5 in both `x` and `y` directions. This grid is used for visualizing functions and vector fields.

---
## **2. Symbolic Variable Definitions and Velocity Components**
```matlab
syms x y u(x,y) v(x,y) phi(x,y) psi(x,y)
u(x,y) = 2*(x.^2 - y.^2);
v(x,y) = -4.*x.*y;
```
- **Symbolic Variables:** `syms` defines symbolic variables `x`, `y`, `u`, `v`, `phi`, and `psi` for analytical calculations.
- **Velocity Components:**
  - `u(x,y)` represents the x-component of velocity.
  - `v(x,y)` represents the y-component of velocity.

The velocity field is defined as:
- **u(x,y):** \( u = 2(x^2 - y^2) \)
- **v(x,y):** \( v = -4xy \)

---
## **3. Velocity Potential and Stream Function**
```matlab
phi(x,y) = int(u, x) + int(v, y);
psi(x,y) = int(u, y) - int(v, x);
```
- **Velocity Potential (\(\phi\)):**
  - Calculated by integrating the velocity components. \(\phi(x, y) = \int u\,dx + \int v\,dy\)
  
- **Stream Function (\(\psi\)):**
  - Similarly calculated using \(\psi(x, y) = \int u\,dy - \int v\,dx\).

These symbolic integrals represent the scalar fields \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) associated with the velocity field.

---
## **4. Visualization of the Velocity Field and Potential**
```matlab
figure;
contourf(X, Y, phi(X, Y), 50);
hold on;
quiver(X, Y, u(X, Y), v(X, Y));
title("velocity potential");
axis equal;
```

- **Contour Plot of \(\phi\):**
  - `contourf` plots filled contours of the velocity potential \(\phi\) over the grid.
  - `50` specifies the number of contour levels for smooth visualization.

- **Quiver Plot of Velocity Field:**
  - `quiver` overlays arrows representing the vector field of velocity \((u, v)\).
  - This provides insight into the direction and magnitude of the flow.

- **Additional Formatting:**
  - `title`: Adds a title to the plot.
  - `axis equal`: Ensures equal scaling for the x and y axes, maintaining the physical proportions of the field.

---
## **5. Purpose of the Code**
- To analyze and visualize the velocity field and associated scalar fields (velocity potential \(\phi\) and stream function \(\psi\)).
- This is a common approach in fluid mechanics and applied mathematics for studying flow patterns.

---
## **Possible Extensions**
- Visualize the stream function \(\psi\) with a similar contour plot.
- Analyze specific flow properties like stagnation points or streamline behavior.
- Add annotations or legends to enhance interpretability.
